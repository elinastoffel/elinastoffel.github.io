## Introduction
![](https://media.giphy.com/media/drXGoW1iudhKw/giphy.gif)



I'm **Elina Stoffel, MD**, a GI fellow and clinical researcher at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.  
My work focuses on **alcohol-related liver disease**, **transplant outcomes**, and **health disparities in hepatology**.

This site provides an overview of my ongoing research projects, selected [publications](publications.html), and dashboards developed in R and Plotly. Iâ€™m particularly interested in how predictive modeling and real-world data can inform early detection and intervention strategies for liver disease.

I also use [google](https://www.google.com/) a ton.

To show that you can just use RMD like normal, check out [this page](plots.html) with plots.
