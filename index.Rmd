## Introduction
![](https://media.giphy.com/media/drXGoW1iudhKw/giphy.gif)



I'm **Elina Stoffel, MD**, a GI fellow and clinical researcher at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.  
My work focuses on **alcohol-related liver disease**, **transplant outcomes**, and **health disparities in hepatology**.

This site provides an overview of my [ongoing research projects](ongoing.html), selected [publications](publications.html), and dashboards developed in R and Plotly. I’m particularly interested in how predictive modeling and real-world data can inform early detection and intervention strategies for liver disease.
